Epochor: The Decentralized Subnet for Time-Series Intelligence
Time is everywhere.
Every process — economic, biological, environmental, computational — unfolds over time.
These processes leave behind patterns we call time series.

From financial markets to weather systems, IoT sensors to neural activity,
time series data is central to understanding and predicting the world.
Yet most machine learning systems are built for static data —
ignoring the dynamics that truly define our reality.

The Temporal package is designed to change that —
providing the tools to build foundation models for time series.
Models that can generalize across domains, scales, and modalities.
But building and training such models at scale requires more than code.

This is where Epochor comes in.
Epochor is a decentralized Bittensor subnet focused entirely on time.
It’s a network for training, evaluating, and rewarding general-purpose time series models.

A place where models learn to understand change, dynamics, and sequence.

A system where contributors are incentivized to build better models —
not just for one task, but for the broad landscape of temporal data.

Like an epoch, Epochor tracks progression.
But it also implies persistence — a long-term, collective effort to model time itself.

Why Epochor?
Because time is a fundamental axis of intelligence.

Because centralized training is a bottleneck.

And because collective learning is more powerful than isolated research.

Epochor provides a decentralized framework for building
robust, adaptable, and generalizable time series models —
open to researchers, developers, and validators alike.

The Future of Time-Aware AI is Collaborative
Epochor and Temporal work together:

Temporal builds the architecture.

Epochor scales the intelligence.

Together, they form an open ecosystem for temporal AI —
grounded in time, powered by incentive, and built for the real world.
