🌌 Epochor: The Decentralized Subnet for Temporal Intelligence
Time is the dimension of everything.
It shapes economies, biological systems, infrastructure, cognition — even the models we use to understand it.

Time series are how we observe these processes — rich sequences of change that underpin nearly every complex system. Yet most foundation models have ignored time, focusing instead on static data or unstructured text.

Epochor is an open, decentralized Bittensor subnet built to change that.

It trains, ranks, and rewards models for understanding temporal structure — from forecasting to representation learning — across domains.

Just as an epoch marks a span of time, Epochor marks a collaborative effort to make temporal reasoning a first-class citizen in AI.
 
⚙️ What Epochor Does
🧠 Trains foundation models for time series forecasting and embeddings

🎯 Scores models using robust metrics like CRPS, MQ Loss, Spectral, and Kernel-based divergences

🪙 Rewards contributors based on their performance and generalizability

🔌 Integrates directly with temporal, a modular framework for building temporal transformers

🤝 Why a Decentralized Subnet?
Temporal data is diverse — crossing domains like:

Finance

Weather & climate

Health signals

IoT & sensors

Natural processes

Training general models requires diverse data, perspectives, and continual adaptation.

A decentralized architecture allows:

Global participation

Open innovation

Aligned incentives

Continual model evolution

🪐 The Mission
To build general-purpose models that reason over time.
To unlock a new generation of AI that understands the world not just as it is — but as it unfolds.

Epochor provides a decentralized framework for building
robust, adaptable, and generalizable time series models —
open to researchers, developers, and validators alike.

The Future of Time-Aware AI is Collaborative
Epochor and Temporal work together:

Temporal builds the architecture.

Epochor scales the intelligence.

Together, they form an open ecosystem for temporal AI —
grounded in time, powered by incentive, and built for the real world.
