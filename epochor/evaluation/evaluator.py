"""
Handles loading a miner's model and evaluating it via a Benchmarker.

This module provides a function to safely load a model, typically from
Hugging Face (HF) Hub, and then run an evaluation using a provided
Benchmarker instance. It includes error handling for both model loading
and the evaluation process.

    Load a model from Hugging Face Hub and evaluate it using the Benchmarker.

    This function attempts to load a model specified by `model_repo_id`.
    If successful, it runs the benchmark using `bm.run()`.
    It catches and logs exceptions during both loading and evaluation,
    returning a dictionary with an "error" key in such cases.

    Args:
        bm: An instance of a Benchmarker subclass.
        model_repo_id: The identifier for the model on Hugging Face Hub
                       (e.g., "username/model_name").
        seed: An integer seed for the benchmark run, passed to bm.run().

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing metric scores if successful,
        or a dictionary with an "error" key (str) and error message (str)
        if any exception occurs.
